# vmiterate
#   dev vm iteration: automates destroy, create, provision
#
# desc:
#   - provisions from lv with base images written onto them
#   - creates thin snapshot from the image as base for vm
#   - creates vm from snapshot using libvirt kvm
#   - creates cloud-init cidata volume with meta-data and user-data
#   - provisions vm using cloud-init to bootstrap for ansible
#   - (complete the system configuration via ssh using another role)
#
# tested:
#   - centos6 and ubuntu14 generic cloud images (from vendor)
#   - vendor images only had size fixed, dhcp disabled before writing to lv
#
# steps:
#   - thin volume
#   - virtual machine
#   - static network
#   - system locale
#   - rsa hostkey
#   - config superuser
#   - ssh authkey
#   - rest left to cfmgmt
#
# todo:
#   - factor into roles
#   - split create and destroy (tags?)
#   - enumerate assumptions / prerequisites
#   - document endpoint, what state machine is in
#   - publish
#   - gce, lxc, linode, ec2
